Demos
=====

There are currently two Space demonstration applications.
The first demo adds `MoveIt2 <https://moveit.ros.org/>`_ to the Space ROS foundation, which is used to plan the motion for the `Canadarm manipulator <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadarm>`_, running in simulation.
The second demo shows the `Mars Curiosity rover <https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/home/>`_ in simulation, presenting multiple ROS 2 services to directly control the rover.
The following pages go into detail to show you how to run these demo applications.
